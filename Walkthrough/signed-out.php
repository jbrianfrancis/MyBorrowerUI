				                information.
				            </p>
				            <p>
				                The information provided by the lender includes your name, e-mail address, telephone
				                number, the last four digits of your Social Security Number, your employer’s name,
				                net paycheck amount, the amount of required reserve funds, your loan number, and

				                When we receive information from third parties, we will treat the acquired information

				                we may share aggregated, non-personal information, as described in this policy -
				                that may include information we obtained from third parties in a form that does
				                not permit you to be identified.

				                To Whom We May Disclose The Information We Collect</h2>
				            <p>
				                We understand the sensitive and confidential nature of the information you provide
				                to us. Therefore, we will not disclose this information except as described in this
				                policy.</p>
				            <p>
				                <strong>Verification of Deposit service delivery: </strong>We will disclose the
				                information we receive from your financial institutions to your lender in order
				                to deliver the Verification of Deposit and Asset service.
				            </p>
				            <p>
				                <strong>Disclosure for legal reasons: </strong>We may release personal information
				                to third parties: (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation,
				                search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (2) in special cases, such as a physical
				                threat to you or others, a threat to homeland security, a threat to our system or
				                network, or cases in which we believe it is reasonably necessary to investigate
				                or prevent harm, fraud, abuse, or illegal conduct. In the event that we are legally
				                compelled to disclose your personal information to a third party, we will make reasonable
				                efforts to notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court order.</p>
				            <p>
				                <strong>Agents and contractors: </strong>Contractors sometimes have access to your
				                personal information in the course of assisting in operating our business and providing
				                products or services to you. These contractors include vendors and suppliers that
				                provide us with technology, services, and/or content for the operation and maintenance
				                of our site. Some of these relationships may be with companies that co-brand portions
				                of their site and services, or that provide services to you on our behalf. Co-branded
				                sites may have their own privacy policies posted on their sites. If you visit a
				                co-branded site, please read the privacy policy that is posted on that site. Access
				                to your personal information by these contractors is limited to the information
				                reasonably necessary for the contractor to perform its limited function. Contractors
				                have an obligation under their contracts with us to keep your information confidential
				                and to comply with our privacy and security policies.</p>
				            <p>
				                <strong>Changes in our corporate structure: </strong>If all or part of our company
				                is sold, merged or otherwise transferred to another entity, the personal information
				                you have provided to us may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will
				                take steps to ensure that, without your consent, any personal information that is
				                transferred will not be used or shared in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy
				                Policy under which it was collected.</p>
